<p>

<h3>Call for short papers</h3>
The main goal of the CIBB international conference is to provide a multi-disciplinary forum open to researchers interested in the application of computational intelligence, in a broad sense, to open problems in bioinformatics, computational biology, biostatistics, systems and synthetic biology and medical informatics. Cutting-edge methodologies capable of accelerating life science discoveries will be the main focus of the conference, together with data mining technologies applied to real-life scenarios in biology and health. Following its tradition and roots, this year's meeting will gather researchers and practitioners from the international scientific community interested in advancements and future perspectives in bioinformatics and biostatistics. Moreover, looking at current trends and future opportunities at the edge of computer and life sciences, the application of computational intelligence to system and synthetic biology, and the consequent impact on innovative medicine will be of great interest for the participants. Theoretical and experimental biologists are also invited to participate in order to present novel challenges and foster multidisciplinary collaboration.
<p>

The scientific program of CIBB 2021 will include keynote speakers, tutorials, and special sessions. Contributed papers will be presented in plenary oral sessions, and special sessions. The CIBB 2021 conference will be an online event.
This call for papers invites researchers to submit a short paper (4–6 pages) that will go through a peer review and, if accepted, will be presented at the conference. 
After the conference, the authors of all the accepted short papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their manuscripts to the conference proceedings book in <a href="https://www.springer.com/series/5381"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springer Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI)</a> or to a journal supplement in <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Bioinformatics</a> or <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making</a>.

<p>

<h3>Call for tutorials and special sessions</h3>
CIBB 2021 will run a number of tutorials and special sessions. Any topic of interest for the conference is eligible for a tutorial. Tutorials typically last from one to three hours. Special sessions focus on a specific, possibly cutting-edge topic of interest for the CIBB audience. special session organisers will be responsible for call dissemination, the reviewing process and organizing oral presentations. Typically, a special session will have around 4 accepted papers and might have an invited speaker.
</br>

</p>
Special Session proposals, including the session's title and scope, short CV of session chairs, and name of the main corresponding organizer are due by <strike>15 July 2021</strike> 31 July 2021. Proposals of special sessions will be evaluated as soon as they are submitted. An approved special session can happen if it has at least 3 short papers accepted; if not, the accepted papers are included in the conference main track. Special session proposals should be sent via email to the conference chairs at <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins>
