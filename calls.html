<h3>Deadlines</h3>
Special session and tutorial proposal submission: 15 July 2021</br>
Short paper submission: 15 September 2021 </br>
Acceptance/rejection notification: 15 October 2021</br>
Camera ready due: 30 October 2021</br>
Conference: 15-17 November 2021</br>
<p>

<h3>Call for tutorials and special sessions</h3>
CIBB 2021 will run a number of tutorials and special sessions. Any topic of interest for the conference is eligible for a tutorial. Tutorials typically last from one to three hours. Special sessions focus on a specific, possibly cutting-edge, topic of interest for CIBB 2019. special session organisers will be responsible for call dissemination, the reviewing process and organizing oral presentations. Typically, a special session will have around 4 accepted papers and might have an invited speaker.
</br>
Tutorial proposals, including title, a one page long abstract, and short CV of presenters, are due by 15 July 2021, and should be sent via email to the conference chairs at <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins>
</p>
Special Session proposals, including the session's title and scope, short CV of session chairs, are due by 15 July 2021. Proposals of special sessions will be evaluated as soon as they are submitted. An approved special session can happen if it has at least 3 short papers accepted; if not, the accepted papers are included in the conference main track. Special session proposals should be sent via email to the conference chairs at <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins>

<h3>Call for short papers</h3>
The main goal of the CIBB international conference is to provide a multi-disciplinary forum open to researchers interested in the application of computational intelligence, in a broad sense, to open problems in bioinformatics, computational biology, biostatistics, systems and synthetic biology and medical informatics. Cutting-edge methodologies capable of accelerating life science discoveries will be the main focus of the conference, together with data mining technologies applied to real-life scenarios in biology and health. Following its tradition and roots, this year's meeting will gather researchers and practitioners from the international scientific community interested in advancements and future perspectives in bioinformatics and biostatistics. Also, looking at current trends and future opportunities at the edge of computer and life sciences, the application of computational intelligence to system and synthetic biology, and the consequent impact on innovative medicine will be of great interest for the participants. Theoretical and experimental biologists are also invited to participate in order to present novel challenges and foster multidisciplinary collaboration.
<p>

The scientific program of CIBB 2021 will include keynote speakers, tutorials and special sessions. Contributed papers will be presented in plenary oral sessions, and special sessions. The CIBB 2021 conference will be an online event.
This call for papers invites researchers to submit a short paper (4-6 pages) that will go through a peer review and, if accepted, will be presented at the conference. 
After the conference, the authors of all the accepted short papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their manuscript for the conference proceedings book in <a href="https://www.springer.com/series/5381"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springer Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI)</a> or for a journal supplement in <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Bioinformatics</a> or <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making</a>.

<h3>Submission of short papers</h3>
Prospective authors should submit short papers prepared according to the following instructions:
<ul>
<li>The short papers should be submitted in PDF format (this is the only accepted format).</li>
<li>The short papers length should be at least 4 pages and should not exceed 6 pages in total.</li>
<li>The short papers should be written in British English or North American English. Please perform a grammar spell-check and correct any typos or mistakes before the submission.</li>
<li>The short papers should include 10 references at most.</li>
</ul>

We warmly recommend the use of the provided templates available for <a href="CIBB_paper_latex_template.zip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LaTeX (preferred)</a>, <a href="CIBB_paper_LibreOffice_template.odt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice Writer</a>, and <a href="CIBB_paper_Microsoft_Word_template.docx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Word</a>.

<p>

<h3>Publication</h3>
PDF versions of accepted papers will be distributed at the conference. At least one author of an accepted paper is required to register and present the paper at the conference.
</br>
Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a post-conference monograph. We plan to invite all papers for a volume in the Springer series of Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI).
</br>
Continuing the tradition of CIBB, we also plan to invite all the papers, as an alternative to the publication on LNBI, to a special issue of an international scientific journal (such as BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Medical Informatics, as in the latest editions).
Please see <a href="past_editions.html">the past editions webpage</a> to find the books of the proceedings and supplements of the past editions of the conference to get a sense of them.
