Aims and scope. 
Neurodegenerative diseases, although with different disease courses, are characterized by progressive or alternate impairment involving the functions of the nervous system. Artificial intelligence solutions might provide useful insights on disease aetiology, progression, and phenotypes, to support clinical decision and enhance the quality of medical assistance and homecare. The increasing amount and variety of collected data (clinical, -omics, imaging, sensors) constitute a basis for innovative ways to study and analyze neurodegenerative diseases, both at
population and single-patient levels. 
The ability to predict or simulate disease course, risk or timing of adverse events, exacerbation and relapses allows to personalize a patient’s treatment plan or otherwise inform their personal decisions, for example with respect to end-of-life care. Moreover, one of the biggest challenges of these diseases is to decipher their possible heterogeneity among patients, who may display widely different patterns of disease manifestation and progression. 
Thus, successfully identifying clinically meaningful sub-groups of patients (that is, patients’ stratification) would be of great value for advancing the development of effective treatments and achieving better care for patients.

<!-- <h4>Bio-inspired AI and AI-inspired (bio)chemical intelligence: a viable two-way path?</h4>

Aim and scope.
Research in the field of the "Sciences of the Artificial" aims at constructing artifacts capable to behave like biological systems. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one these sciences,   together with Robotics, and Synthetic (or Artificial) Biology. They represent three different ways of implementing artificiality, respectively, in the software, hardware, and wetware domains.</br>
The subject of this special issue refers to the interplay between software and wetware domains.</br>
We know that biological structures and functions have profoundly inspired AI. Biologically inspired computing methods have literally revolutionized the field. Approaches such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and membrane computing - just to mention a few names – are typical examples of bio-inspired computing. No doubts that those approaches are contributing to the impressive success of AI methods we witness in present days.
On the other hand, the current advancements in Synthetic Biology allow the construction of synthetic biosystems by modifying extant cells or even by constructing very simple cell models from scratch. Such a new experimental horizon can pave the way to somehow unexpected approaches, i.e., those derived from a sort of reversal inspiration, whereby current AI methods (bio-inspired or not) actually inspire or even guide the construction of artificial (bio)chemical intelligent systems. The latter are built in the laboratory and can
display unique features not available to the silicon AI.</br>
Such a dual dimension and the reciprocal influences among these fields constitutes an interesting case for enquiring novel aspects of computation, following inspirational flows from biology to computing and from computing to artificial biology, the latter being not necessarily coincident with biology.</br>
In this special session we are interested in collecting contributions from specialists who would like to comment the theoretical, computational, biological, chemical, epistemological aspect of this scenario, and discuss about current and future trends in the fields of bio-inspired AI and AI-inspired (bio)chemical intelligence.</br>
</p>

Relevant topics within this context include:</br>
<ul>
<li>Bio-inspired AI</li>
<li>AI-inspired (bio)chemical intelligence</li>
<li>Bio-chem-ICTs</li>
<li>Molecular communications</li>
<li>Synthetic biology</li>
<li>Chemical neural networks</li>
<li>Artificial biochemistry</li>
<li>Systems dynamics</li>
<li>Embodied AI (in the chemical domain)</li>

Aims and scope
With the steep decline in the cost of many high-throughput technologies, large amounts of biological data are being generated and made accessible to researchers. Machine learning (ML) has been brought into the spotlight as a very useful approach to understand and retrieve insights from big biodata (molecular and otherwise) with the potential to result in ground-breaking medical applications. This is clearly reflected in the corresponding growth of ML publications, reporting a wide range of modelling techniques in biology.</br>
</p>

There are opportunities to advance Machine Learning research and development, and increase the benefit of Machine Learning to science by improving the reusability of science data and ML models and through the development of methodologies and services to seamlessly and routinely integrate AI into science workflows. In this context, there is a large amount of focus on implementing the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, interoperable and reproducible), both in ELIXIR, Research Data Alliance (RDA) and elsewhere, initially focused on data and now software and other products but generally not ML models.</br>
In the context of this special session, we will be discussing some key challenges, opportunities and achievements for Machine Learning, with a view towards Life Sciences.
Such topics include the DOME Recommendations (see <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01205-4"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Nature Methods article</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16189"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its preprint</a>) and <a href="https://www.rd-alliance.org/defining-fair-machine-learning-ml"   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the FAIR for Machine Learning activities in Research Data Alliance</a>.</br>

<h4>Machine learning in healthcare informatics and medical biology</h4>

Aim and scope.
Machine learning has become a pivotal tool to analyze biomedical and biological datasets, especially in the Big Data era. In fact, machine learning algorithms can identify hidden relationships and structures in health care data, and even take advantage of them to make accurate predictions about similar or future data instances. For example, machine learning software has been able to predict the diagnosis of tumor patients just by processing patients' clinical features, allowing scientists to save time and money compared to wet lab experiments. Computational researchers have also exploited machine learning to infer knowledge about patients by analyzing biological datasets, especially the ones featuring genetics and epigenomic traits. Data mining approaches applied to such datasets, in fact, can lead to relevant discoveries both to understand molecular biology and to gain new knowledge about patients’ diseases. 
</p>
Our special session on "Machine Learning in Healthcare Informatics and Medical Biology" aims at boosting these scientific fields, calling for researchers able to show the potential and the advance of machine learning algorithms to make accurate computational predictions in health care datasets and in patient-oriented biological datasets. 
</p>

Topics of interest include:
<ul>
<li> Machine learning methods applied to health care and biomedical datasets </li>
<li> Machine learning methods applied to genetics and epigenomics datasets, to understand the conditions of healthy and/or sick patients  </li>
<li> Machine learning methods applied to biological datasets to understand the underlying biomolecular scenario  </li>
<li> Machine learning software and tools in the health care and biological domain  </li>
<li> Statistical models to analyze health care, biomedical, and biological datasets  </li>
<li> Data mining applications in the health care and biological domain  </li>
</ul>
