Aim and scope.
Computational biology deals with the analysis of biological systems at different scales of complexity, using proper modeling frameworks and computational methods. Given that Computational biology approaches and modelling systems are becoming well established, the challenge is now to apply the developed techniques towards the definition of personalized models to identify individually tailored drugs and therapies, that is to realize the <i>personalized medicine</i> paradigm. The scope of this special session is to bring together researchers involved in the development of methods and models applied to the fields of computational biology and systems medicine.</br>
</p>

Topics of interest include</br>
<ul>
<li>Biomedical model parameterization and verification</li>
<li>Models of neural activity</li>
<li>Individual-aware models to assess genetic variation effects on cellular regulatory network</li>
<li>Cancer progression models</li>
<li>Epidemiological models</li>
<li>Multiscale modeling and simulation of biological systems</li>
<li>Space-temporal modeling and simulation of biological systems</li>
<li>Robustness of cellular networks</li>
<li>Emergent properties in complex biological systems</li>
<li>Metabolic and signal pathway analysis and engineering</li>
<li>Genetic variants effects on epigenome</li>
<li>Models for personalized and targeted therapies</li>

Aims and scope. 
Neurodegenerative diseases, although with different disease courses, are characterized by progressive or alternate impairment involving the functions of the nervous system. Artificial intelligence solutions might provide useful insights on disease aetiology, progression, and phenotypes, to support clinical decision and enhance the quality of medical assistance and homecare. The increasing amount and variety of collected data (clinical, -omics, imaging, sensors) constitute a basis for innovative ways to study and analyze neurodegenerative diseases, both at
population and single-patient levels. 
The ability to predict or simulate disease course, risk or timing of adverse events, exacerbation and relapses allows to personalize a patient’s treatment plan or otherwise inform their personal decisions, for example with respect to end-of-life care. Moreover, one of the biggest challenges of these diseases is to decipher their possible heterogeneity among patients, who may display widely different patterns of disease manifestation and progression. 
Thus, successfully identifying clinically meaningful sub-groups of patients (that is, patients’ stratification) would be of great value for advancing the development of effective treatments and achieving better care for patients.
</br>
Our special session aims at fostering the synergistic interaction between advanced artificial intelligence and statistical methods and clinical research in neurodegenerative diseases.</br>
</p>

Topics of interest include:
<ul>
<li>Artificial intelligence, machine learning, Bayesian and statistical methods, big data analytics</li>
<li>Computational approaches for patient stratification, prognosis or onset prediction</li>
<li>Data mining, process mining, information retrieval, temporal and spatial representation and reasoning</li>
<li>Simulation models, software, and tools (clinical decision support systems, patient engagement support, visual analytics, solutions for assisted living, and telemedicine)</li>
<li>Genetics, -omics, and environmental data analysis</li>
<li>Clinical image analysis, signal processing, natural language processing</li>
<li>Explainable AI and model interpretation</li>
</ul>

With applications to neurodegenerative diseases, including:
<ul>
<li>Motor neuron diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)</li>
<li>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</li>
<li>Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias</li>
<li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
<li>Prion disease</li>
<li>Huntington’s disease</li>
<li>Other chronic or degenerative neurological conditions</li>
</ul>
