<h3>Post-conference proceedings and journal supplements</h3>

After the conference, the authors of all the accepted short papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version of their manuscripts to the conference proceedings book in <a href="https://www.springer.com/series/5381"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springer Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI)</a> or to a journal supplement in <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Bioinformatics</a> or <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making</a>.
</br>

</div>

The publication of the accepted extended articles in the Springer LNBI will be free of charge for the authors, and the articles published will be non-open access. That means that readers, universities, and libraries will have to pay a subscription to read these articles. Springer LNBI is a subseries of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).</br>
</p>

The publication of each accepted extended article in the BMC journal supplements, instead, will cost approximately 1,800&euro; to be paid by the article's authors to BioMed Central. The articles published in the BMC journals will then be <a href="https://youtu.be/L5rVH1KGBCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open access</a> and free to read for anyone in the world. </br>
Regarding the BMC supplements, we expect all the extended articles to be proposed as "research", "database" or "software" content type. If some authors think their article should be prepared following a different content type, they should get in touch with the conference chairs to discuss it (email: <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins>).
</br>
</p>

The authors are allowed to post their extended articles on preprint servers such as <a href="https://www.arxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bioRxiv</a>, and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medRxiv</a> before the submission to the Springer LNBI book or to the BMC journal supplements.
</br>
</p>

The authors are allowed to use all the content (text, images, tables) of their short papers for the preparation of the extended articles.</br>
The title of each extended article should be slightly different from the title of the corresponding short paper.</br>
The list of authors and their order should be the same between short paper and extended article; possible changes should be discussed with the conference chairs  (email: <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins>).

<h3>Springer LNBI proceedings</h3>
The authors of accepted short papers interested in submitting an extended article to the Springer LNBI book need write an email to <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins> before 21 January 2021 indicating their intentions. This way can know how many submitted chapters we will receive.
</br>
</p>

The authors can read the <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springer LNBI/LNCS guidelines article preparation here</a>. The suggested limit for the chapters' length is 12 pages, while the strict limit is 15 pages.</br>
The articles can be submitted on the <a href="https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/cibb2021"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EquinOCS website</a>.
</br>
</p>

The submitted extended articles will go through a single review phase, where the three general chairs of the CIBB 2021 conference will serve as proceedings' editors. The final decision on the acceptance or rejection of the submitted extended chapters will be made by the  proceedings' editors.
</br>
</p>

<b>Deadline.</b> Submission of extended articles for the Springer LNBI book: <font size="+2" style="color:#228B22">30 March 2022</font></br>


<h3>BMC supplements</h3>
The authors of accepted short papers interested in submitting an extended article to a BMC supplement need to download, fill, sign, scan and submit the <a href="CIBB_2021_Letter_of_interesest_supplements_BioMed.odt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supplement submission letter of interest (.odt)</a> to <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins> before 21 January 2021. 
The red text parts of the letter should be replaced with the requested information. The letter should be submitted as a PDF file attached to an email.
This document is important for us so we can know how many extended articles we will receive.
</br>
</p>

The authors can read the <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Bioinformatics guidelines here</a> and the <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making guidelines here</a>. There are no page limits for the BMC journals.</br>
The articles can be submitted on the <a href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/supp/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Supplements website</a>.
</br>
</p>

The submitted extended articles will go through two review phases. In the first phase, the three general chairs of the CIBB 2021 conference will serve as guest editors. Some special session chairs might be involved as additional guest editors, in case of high number of submissions. At the end of the first review phase, the guest editors will recommend all the submitted extended articles for acceptance or rejection, and pass them all to the BMC journals' editor-in-chiefs who will take care of the second review phase.</br>
The BMC editor-in-chief can decide to confirm the guest editors' recommendation, or to start a new review phase (with new reviewers invited, new reviews, new requests, etc). The BMC editor-in-chief will eventually make the final decision on the acceptance or rejection of each extended manuscript. Please notice that, even if the guest editors suggest the acceptance for a specific paper, the BMC editor-in-chief can still decide to reject it (this case is quite rare but it can still happen).
</br>
</p>

<b>Deadline.</b> Submission of extended articles for the BMC supplements: <font size="+2" style="color:#0088cc">16 February 2022</font></br>
</p>

We will try handle the review phase of the extended articles submitted to the BMC supplements quickly so that any rejected manuscripts can be submitted to the Springer LNBI book, if the authors want it.
</br>
