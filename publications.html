<h3>Post-conference proceedings and journal supplements</h3>

After the conference, the authors of all the accepted short papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version of their manuscripts to the conference proceedings book in <a href="https://www.springer.com/series/5381"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Springer Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI)</a> or to a journal supplement in <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Bioinformatics</a> or <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making</a>.
</br>
</p>

<a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="bmcmedical.jpg" width="100" align="right" hspace="20"></a>
</div>

The publication of the accepted extended articles in the Springer LNBI will be free of charge for the authors, and the articles published will be non-open access. That means that readers, universities, and libraries will have to pay a subscription to read these articles. Springer LNBI is a subseries of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).</br>
</p>

The publication of each accepted extended article in the BMC journal supplements, instead, will cost approximately 1,800&euro; to be paid by the article's authors to BioMed Central. The articles published in the BMC journals will then be <a href="https://youtu.be/L5rVH1KGBCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open access</a> and free to read for anyone in the world. </br>
Regarding the BMC supplements, we expect all the extended articles to be proposed as "research", "database" or "software" content type. If some authors think their article should be prepared following a different content type, they should get in touch with the conference chairs to discuss it (email: <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins>).
</br>
</p>

The authors are allowed to post their extended articles on preprint servers such as <a href="https://www.arxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bioRxiv</a>, and <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">medRxiv</a> before the submission to the Springer LNBI book or to the BMC journal supplements.
</br>
</p>

The authors are allowed to use all the content (text, images, tables) of their short papers for the preparation of the extended articles.</br>
The title of each extended article should be slightly different from the title of the corresponding short paper.</br>
The list of authors and their order should be the same between short paper and extended article; possible changes should be discussed with the conference chairs  (email: <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins>).
</br>
</p>

 
<font style="color:#ff0000">2022-02-15 Update. The CIBB 2021 option is finally available on the BMC supplements submission website. Sorry for all the delays. Please proceed with the manuscript submission before the scheduled deadline of 16th February 2022.  To visualize the CIBB 2021 option, you need to start a new submission from scratch on the BMC Supplements website.</font>
</br>
</p>

<font style="color:#006400">2022-03-04 Update. As some of the authors know, there have been some issues with the handling of the submitted extended articles. BioMed Central took 16 days to add our CIBB 2021 guest editors to the BMC Supplements website list of editors, and this wait delayed the start of the review for most of the submitted manuscripts. All the articles are under review now.  </font>
</br>
</p>

<font style="color:#ff0000">2022-04-25 Update. All the extended articles submitted to the BMC supplements, except two of them, have been reviewed and the authors have been informed about their first outcome decision and their reviews by the guest editors. We are still handling the first review phase of two articles, whose delay has been caused by reviewers who originally had accepted to provide review reports but then did not actually submit anything in the due time. This problem has delayed the review phase and made it necessary to look for new reviewers and subsequently to wait for their review reports. We apologize to the authors of these two articles for this delay.  </font>  
</br>
</p>

<font style="color:#006400">2022-05-17 Update. All the extended articles submitted to the BMC supplements have now received the first review decision and the first round of reviews from the handling guest editors. Some of these articles have already finished the first phase of the review process and are now in the hands of a BioMed editor-in-chief, who will make the final decision on them. In the meantime, we started the review phase of the extended articles for the Springer LNBI proceedings book through EquinOCS.</font>  
</br>
</p>

<font style="color:#ff0000">2022-06-14 Update. The review process of the articles submitted to Springer LNBI is moving forward on EquinOCS. The authors of almost 74% of the submitted articles received the first round of reviews and were notified about the first outcome. There has been a delay regarding the other 26% of the articles, again due to reviewers who originally had accepted to provide review reports but then did not actually submit anything in the due time. This problem made it necessary for us guest editors to look for new reviewers, to reassign the submitted articles to them, and to wait for new reports. We apologize for this delay. </font>  
</br>
</p>

<font style="color:#006400">2022-06-27 Update. The review process of the articles submitted to Springer LNBI is moving forward on EquinOCS. The authors of all the submitted articles received the first round of reviews and the notification about the first outcome. Some articles are already experiencing the second phase of the review process. </font>  
</br>
</p>

<font style="color:#ff0000">2022-07-12 Update. We discovered another flaw in the Editorial Manager website provided by BioMed for the articles of the CIBB 2021 supplement: sometimes, when the articles are submitted by the authors, the system does not notify the guest editors about it, causing many delays as you can imagine. We invite the authors of all the articles under review who would like to get updates about the status of their papers to contact Omar El Bakry <ins>omar.elbakry(AT)biomedcentral.com</ins> or Myra Morelada at <ins>myra.moraleda(AT)springernature.com</ins> of the BioMed Supplements office. When contacting them, please include the article's ID (SUPP-D-22-000XX) and its title both in the email subject and in the email text.</br>
If you receive no reply from Omar El Bakry and Myra Morelada, feel free to to contact the editor-in-chief Alison Cuff at <ins>alison.cuff(AT)biomedcentral.com</ins>
</font>  
</br>
</p>

<font style="color:#006400">2022-07-21 Update. Both the review phases of the articles submitted to the BMC supplements and of the Springer LNBI volume are moving on. Springer informed us that the number of the CIBB 2021 proceedings volume will be 13483. The title of the book therefore will be: 
<blockquote>Computational Intelligence Methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, 17th International Meeting, CIBB 2021, Virtual Event, November 15â€“17, 2021, Revised Selected Papers, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, volume 13483, Springer Cham, 2022.</blockquote></font>  


<font style="color:#ff0000">2022-08-08 Update. 
 The first articles of the supplement of the BMC Bioinformatics journal regarding CIBB 2021 have been published in the <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/supplements/volume-23-supplement-6"   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Bioinformatics volume 23 supplement 6</a>.

</br>
</p>

<b>Deadline.</b> Submission of extended articles for the Springer LNBI book: <strike>30 March 2022</strike> <font size="+2" style="color:#228B22"> 20 April 2022</font></br>


<h3>BMC supplements</h3>
The authors of accepted short papers interested in submitting an extended article to a BMC supplement need to download, fill, sign, scan and submit the <a href="CIBB_2021_Letter_of_interesest_supplements_BioMed.odt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supplement submission letter of interest (ODT file)</a> to <ins>cibb2021(AT)protonmail.com</ins> before 21 January 2021. 
The red text parts of the letter should be replaced with the requested information. The letter should be submitted as a PDF file attached to an email.
This document is important for us so we can know how many extended articles we will receive.
</br>

<a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="bmcmedical.jpg" width="100" align="right" hspace="20"></a>
</div>


The authors can read the <a href="https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Bioinformatics guidelines here</a> and the <a href="https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making guidelines here</a>. There are no page limits for the BMC journals.</br>
The articles can be submitted on the <a href="https://www.editorialmanager.com/supp/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BMC Supplements website</a>.
</br>
</p>

The submitted extended articles will go through two review phases. In the first phase, the three general chairs of the CIBB 2021 conference will serve as guest editors. Some special session chairs might be involved as additional guest editors, in case of high number of submissions. At the end of the first review phase, the guest editors will recommend all the submitted extended articles for acceptance or rejection, and pass them all to the BMC journals' editor-in-chiefs who will take care of the second review phase.</br>
The BMC editor-in-chief can decide to confirm the guest editors' recommendation, or to start a new review phase (with new reviewers invited, new reviews, new requests, etc). The BMC editor-in-chief will eventually make the final decision on the acceptance or rejection of each extended manuscript. Please notice that, even if the guest editors suggest the acceptance for a specific paper, the BMC editor-in-chief can still decide to reject it (this case is quite rare but it can still happen).
</br>
</p>

<b>Deadline.</b> Submission of extended articles for the BMC supplements: <font size="+2" style="color:#0088cc">16 February 2022</font></br>
</p>

We will try handle the review phase of the extended articles submitted to the BMC supplements quickly so that any rejected manuscripts can be submitted to the Springer LNBI book, if the authors want it.
